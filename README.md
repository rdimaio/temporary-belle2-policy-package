# Temporary Belle II Rucio policy package

This repository houses the policy package used for the Belle II VO tests. The Belle II experiment itself is currently on an older version of Rucio; in the future, this policy package will be moved outside of the `rucio` GitHub organisation, to be hosted by the Belle II experiment.
